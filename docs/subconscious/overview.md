# Subconscious Platform Documentation

## Who We Are

Subconscious is a platform for building and running production agents with tool use and long horizon reasoning with a single API call.

## Our Definition of an Agent

A system that takes in goals and tools, then gets the job done with minimal to zero human intervention.

## When to Use Subconscious

Not every task requires intelligent automation. We break down automatable work into three categories, and we think the hardest tasks have yet to be automated:

### Simple Automation

Basic, predictable tasks that can be automated most efficiently with rigid workflows like Python scripts and simple LLM pipelines.

### Sophisticated Automation

The sweet spot for agents. Tasks involving ambiguity, nuance, and reasoning across edge cases and shifting information. The world is full of these tricky tasks.

### Human-Critical Work

Some tasks require human judgment and should not be automated like large financial decisions, personal care, and military operations.

Subconscious enables never before possible automation of sophisticated tasks. We'd love for you to try our platform and we welcome any feedback.

## How to Use Subconscious

Get started by signing up for our platform and interacting in one of two ways.

### Playground

Experiment and prototype your agents in our interactive and visual playground environment

### API
