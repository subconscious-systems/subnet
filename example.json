Mei Wall Troll: Blocking teammates with Mei's wall during crucial team fights, often followed by playful ribbing in chat.

Overwrought Insult Trash Talk: Complicated, imaginative trash talk for picking off-meta heroes, such as \"stick needles beneath my toenails and kick the ground\" for picking Torb—so needlessly baroque it's more funny than mean, and called out by players for its creativity.\n\n4. 'gg ez' Auto-Responses: Mocking the classic sore-winner phrase by triggering Blizzard’s joke auto-responses (e.g., \"Mom says I’m a good boy!\") in chat, subverting toxicity with humor—these always spark highly upvoted threads.\n\nAll these are celebrated for their blend of creativity, community recognition, and harmless trolling energy."

Mei wall trolling (blocking teammates at key moments, frequently referenced in both meme and story threads),\n3. Absurdly creative trash talk (like the overly complex Torbjörn insult from 'What's the best trash talk'), and\n4. Blizzard's mockery of 'gg ez' with humorous auto-responses.\nEach is celebrated for being more clever or absurd than genuinely disruptive, and is widely recognized within r/Overwatch.
